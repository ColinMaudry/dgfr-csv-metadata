# Metadata for datasets about schools

## Primary and secondary schools (depp-etablissements...)

This file doesn't say much about schools, with only 10 columns. It has no external reference, with the only exception of geographical coordinates (Lambert 93). No INSEE code, no postal code, no address, no Website.

Metadata consequently consists only in datatypes and column names.

## Universities and colleges (fr-esr-...)

Even if as of December 14th the file shows several structural issues, it's rich in data and external references (62 columns!).

The most noticeable colums:

- url = Website of the school
- coordonnees = geographical point (lattitude, longitude)
- element_wikidata = Wikidata entity
- com_code = INSEE code
- code_postal_uai = ZIP code
- flux_rss 
- diverse social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc.)
